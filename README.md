# Text-Mining-Project-

In our past work, which was published this year in PROMISE,17(Please see the attached paper),
we proposed to use crowdsourcing task description, ( aka requirements) to assist in estimating the price of software crowdsourcing tasks. 
Our prediction models consist of different variables/features extracted from each task:

1. Number of user stories
2. Algorithm 
3. Number of links 
4. Number of Nouns
5. Number of links 

We believe that this work can be extended to improve the current models and overcome any limitations. What we are proposing right now is that task description needs to be studied so we can learn from the description of each task. This can be done by extracting phrases or terms that are the most representative of each task. Tasks in our dataset vary in terms of their complexity, length, or the domain knowledge. So, we expect text mining techniques can be applied to extract each task features. 

There are tons of studies in which they applied text mining or machine learning techniques on text-based data. Please do some search to see what you can apply. I am sharing four tasks from TopCoder platform. I would like you to get yourself familiar with our dataset & start thinking about what techniques/methods you can apply. 

Here is what I expect you to do:

1. Please get yourself familiar with our previous work, “Context-Centric Pricing: Early Pricing Models for Software Crowdsourcing Tasks”
2. Check out the shared dataset and find out what techniques can be applied to help you achieve your goal.
3. Check out previous work which applied text mining, Natural Language Processing on similar problems. 
4. Give us, (Dr.Ye Yang & Myself), any feedback as soon as you can.
